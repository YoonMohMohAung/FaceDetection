# FaceDetectionWithHaarCascades

🧠 **Face & Eye Detection using OpenCV**

This project demonstrates **face and eye detection** using **Haar Cascade Classifiers** in OpenCV.  
It includes two scripts:
- `main.py` → Detects faces and eyes from an **image**
- `webcam.py` → Detects faces and eyes **in real time** using your webcam

---

## 📸 Features

- Detects **faces and eyes** using pre-trained Haar Cascade XML classifiers  
- Draws **bounding boxes** around detected faces (blue) and eyes (green)  
- Works with both **static images** and **live webcam feeds**  
- Lightweight and easy to set up — runs entirely on your local machine
